.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
options: -m, \[en]use-mnps Retain MNPs as separate events (default:
false).
-t, \[en]tag-parsed FLAG Tag records which are split apart of a complex
allele with this flag.
-L, \[en]max-length LEN Do not manipulate records in which either the
ALT or REF is longer than LEN (default: 200).
-k, \[en]keep-info Maintain site and allele-level annotations when
decomposing.
Note that in many cases, such as multisample VCFs, these won\[cq]t be
valid post-decomposition.
For biallelic loci in single-sample VCFs, they should be usable with
caution.
-g, \[en]keep-geno Maintain genotype-level annotations when decomposing.
Similar caution should be used for this as for \[en]keep-info.

If multiple allelic primitives (gaps or mismatches) are specified in
a single VCF record, split the record into multiple lines, but drop all
INFO fields.  Does not handle genotypes (yet).  MNPs are split into
multiple SNPs unless the -m flag is provided.  Records generated by splits have th
