options: -f, \[en]info-filter specifies a filter to apply to the info
fields of records, removes alleles which do not pass the filter -g,
\[en]genotype-filter specifies a filter to apply to the genotype fields
of records -k, \[en]keep-info used in conjunction with `-g', keeps
variant info, but removes genotype -s, \[en]filter-sites filter entire
records, not just alleles -t, \[en]tag-pass tag vcf records as
positively filtered with this tag, print all records -F, \[en]tag-fail
tag vcf records as negatively filtered with this tag, print all records
-A, \[en]append-filter append the existing filter tag, don\[cq]t just
replace it -a, \[en]allele-tag apply -t on a per-allele basis.
adds or sets the corresponding INFO field tag -v, \[en]invert inverts
the filter, e.g.\ grep -v -o, \[en]or use logical OR instead of AND to
combine filters -r, \[en]region specify a region on which to target the
filtering, requires a BGZF compressed file which has been indexed with
tabix.
any number of regions may be specified.
.PP
Filter the specified vcf file using the set of filters.
Filters are specified in the form \[lq] : -f\[rq]DP > 10\[dq] # for info
fields -g \[lq]GT = 1|1\[rq] # for genotype fields -f \[lq]CpG\[rq] #
for `flag' fields
.PP
Operators can be any of: =, !, <, >, |, &
.PP
Any number of filters may be specified.
They are combined via logical AND unless \[en]or is specified on the
command line.
Obtain logical negation through the use of parentheses, e.g.\ \[lq]! (
DP = 10 )\[rq]
.PP
For convenience, you can specify \[lq]QUAL\[rq] to refer to the quality
of the site, even though it does not appear in the INFO fields.
